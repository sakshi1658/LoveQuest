            The sun had begun its slow descent, painting the sky in soft hues of
            pink and orange. The city was alive with the distant hum of traffic,
            but in their little world, everything felt calm. Sakshi walked into
            the apartment, letting out a tired sigh as she placed her bag on the
            couch. It had been a long day—meetings, deadlines, and a hundred
            little things that had drained her energy. Adi, already home, peeked
            from the kitchen with a knowing smile. “Tough day?” he asked,
            stirring the two cups of coffee he had just made. “The worst,” she
            mumbled, plopping onto the couch. “I feel like I’ve been running a
            marathon.” Adi chuckled, bringing over her coffee and sitting beside
            her. “Then let’s hit pause.” Sakshi took the mug, her fingers
            wrapping around the warmth. She exhaled deeply, already feeling a
            little lighter. Adi gently pulled her legs over his lap, his fingers
            tracing soft circles on her ankle. For a moment, they sat in
            silence, just letting the comfort of each other’s presence settle
            in. Then, with a teasing grin, Adi reached for his phone. “You know
            what you need?” Sakshi raised an eyebrow. “Sleep?” He laughed. “That
            too. But first…” He tapped his screen, and a familiar melody began
            to fill the room. The soft, soothing notes of their favorite song
            wrapped around them like a warm hug. Sakshi smiled, her head resting
            against his shoulder. “You always know how to make everything
            better.” Adi pressed a kiss to the top of her head. “Always.”

            A gift was placed, tied with a bow, <br />
            But more than that, the words did glow.<br />
            A simple note, yet deep and true,<br />
            Wrapped the heart in something new.<br />

            Not the gift, but what was said,<br />
            Touched the soul, stayed in the head.<br />
            Like a diamond, rare and bright,<br />
            Those words became the favorite light.<br />

            They hugged the heart, held it tight,<br />
            Made the world so warm, so right.<br />
            Material things may bring delight,<br />
            But love in words? Purest light.✨💕

            My Dearest, <br>
            From the moment I met you, my world became brighter, my
            laughter a little louder, and my heart a whole lot fuller. You are,
            without a doubt, the best I could ever ask for. Everything about
            you—the way you smile, the way you speak, the kindness in your
            heart—makes my days feel lighter and my dreams a little sweeter. You
            are the kind of person people write poetry about, the kind of soul
            that makes love feel effortless and real. I don’t know if you
            realize just how incredible you are, but I do. And every time I see
            you, I’m reminded that some people are just meant to be admired,
            cherished, and maybe even loved a little more than they’ll ever
            know. So here’s to you—my favorite thought, my sweetest distraction,
            and the best I could ever ask for. With all my heart, Yours"
