            The sun had begun its slow descent, painting the sky in soft hues of
            pink and orange. The city was alive with the distant hum of traffic,
            but in their little world, everything felt calm. Sakshi walked into
            the apartment, letting out a tired sigh as she placed her bag on the
            couch. It had been a long day—meetings, deadlines, and a hundred
            little things that had drained her energy. Adi, already home, peeked
            from the kitchen with a knowing smile. “Tough day?” he asked,
            stirring the two cups of coffee he had just made. “The worst,” she
            mumbled, plopping onto the couch. “I feel like I’ve been running a
            marathon.” Adi chuckled, bringing over her coffee and sitting beside
            her. “Then let’s hit pause.” Sakshi took the mug, her fingers
            wrapping around the warmth. She exhaled deeply, already feeling a
            little lighter. Adi gently pulled her legs over his lap, his fingers
            tracing soft circles on her ankle. For a moment, they sat in
            silence, just letting the comfort of each other’s presence settle
            in. Then, with a teasing grin, Adi reached for his phone. “You know
            what you need?” Sakshi raised an eyebrow. “Sleep?” He laughed. “That
            too. But first…” He tapped his screen, and a familiar melody began
            to fill the room. The soft, soothing notes of their favorite song
            wrapped around them like a warm hug. Sakshi smiled, her head resting
            against his shoulder. “You always know how to make everything
            better.” Adi pressed a kiss to the top of her head. “Always.”
